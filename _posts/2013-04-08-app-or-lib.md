## TL;DR Version

Anything application specific goes in `app/`, anything not specific to this application goes in `lib/`.
Most importantly, **anything in `lib/` by definition, should not know anything about files in `app/`**.
This is a one-way street: `app/` can know about `lib/` but `lib/` should not know about `app/`.

## Read the Manual

According to the README.rdoc of a fresh Rails install, `app/`:

> Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.

Somewhat confusingly the README.rdoc goes on to explain the purpose of `lib/`:

> Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't belong under controllers, models, or helpers.
> This directory is in the load path.

Application specific libraries may be a bit obtuse in this gem based world.
Perhaps more appropriate it could say application specific customizations of external gems/classes.

## But what really goes in app/ vs. lib/

Do you have an extending module for the String class? Do that in `lib/`.
In this era of `config/initializers` some of the initial purposes of `lib/` is obviated.
(And I imagine this aligns with [David Heinemeier Hansson's desire to organize junk drawers](http://www.rubyinside.com/dhh-keynote-streaming-live-from-railsconf-2011-right-here-right-now-4769.html).

One hangup that I've had to get over is that the directories of `app/` are not sacrosanct.
The "[a-ha](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djV11Xbc914)" moment was during the introduction to the asset pipeline, which brought about a new directory: `app/assets/`.
This change opened the gates for me, and others, to begin adding custom directories to `app/`.

If you need application specific services, make an `app/services/` directory.
Or maybe you want [active\_model\_serializers](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers) to handle the ugly details of serialization.
Or [simple_form custom inputs](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form), you're going to do that in `app/inputs`, then maybe just maybe move them to `lib/`.

And for heavens sake, don't worry about your `app/models/` directory having non-ActiveRecord::Base class definitions.
That directory is your [Domain Models](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_model) directory.
Though there is nothing to say that you can't have an `app/domain_models/` directory.

Ultimately, I would recommend viewing, and using, `lib/` as a staging ground for gem extraction.
Start with your code in `app/` and if you find that code useful for another project, move the relevant code to `lib/` (ensuring that you don't depend on anything in `app/`).
Then begin your gem creation.

And I'll reiterate this again, **any code that you put in `lib/` should be independent of `app/`**.
Or, phrased another way, `lib/` code should be perfectly functional if you removed the `app/` directory.
